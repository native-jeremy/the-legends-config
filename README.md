JavaScript code for front-end configuration.

# Updates 21 August 2023 / Code Alterations Required

	•	Finish hooking up cards on frontend
	•	Create field on front pages (Airtable) for small. Description
	•	
	•	
	•	How will we tell the program which exercise difficulty it should default to for each exercise in a workout? 
	•	When I make a workout, the exercises don't seem to appear in the same order on the front end. Am I missing a step to make this happen? 
		< - | Create a filtered request or find an alternative for ordering | - > 
	•	I created a workout and then added a warm-up round and moved it to the top to be the first round, but on the front end it's still appearing as the last round of the workout, I'm thinking I'm missing the same step here as I am missing with the exercise order too? 
	•	Recovery sessions: We imagined these would be formatted like a workout, but I'm not sure how to build these with the way it's setup in the backend? We would basically have stretches instead of exercises for each effort. 
	•	When Adam and I write up the tutorials for each exercise, will there be a way that we connect these to the right exercise difficulty group so they will automatically link in the workout/workout overview?
	•	Just a couple of other notes for things I've noticed too that I'm not sure if you guys are aware of:
	•	The equipment list for each workout seems to be showing a preview of a program? Not sure where it's pulling this from, but even if I add something to the equipment list on the back end, it's not changing on the front. 
	•	In the list of workouts in the 'weeks' view, the subheadings are all the same for each workout and not changing accordingly, they're all saying HIIT, 30mins. 
	•	In the workout overview where it has the list of rounds and exercises, it's pulling through the 'single exercise' name rather than the 'difficulty group'. It displays the correct one in the actual workout when it overlays the stopmotion file, but at the moment in the workout overview list it's still showing 'Squats s20'. 
	•	Following on from above point, the 'time' in this list isn't changing accordingly, they're all saying 40sec at the moment. 
	•	
	•	
	•	
	•	When clicking on a recipe that's been 'favourited' it's not loading the actual recipe.
	•	'Duration' isn't updating on the header where it says duration over the image. Actually, I think it's the same for all the recipes including the ones you guys have added, they all say 30mins.
	•	There is a big gap between the ingredients and method headers and the lists, can we close that in?
	•	When I 'refine' my dietary requirements and then go to another spot on the program like exercise and come back, it hasn't saved my preferences. Is this something you're working on still? 
	•	When a recipe is saved to favourites the 'Time;' also changes to 30mins in the 'preview' section before you open the recipe. But when in the normal week view or search section it is correct.
	•	When I update my dietary requirements, it obviously removes some recipes that don't fit in with that requirement but then it's not replacing them with others that should be within that dietary requirement.
